# Task Authentification & JWT

- POST /users should accept password field and before save replace it with hash (use bcrypt package).
- Add a POST /login method which accepts JSON with login and password and should return JWT token in response body: { token: <jwt_token> } (use jsonwebtoken package).
- JWT token should contain userId and login in a payload.
- Secret that used for signing the token should be stored in .env file.
- For all client requests the JWT token should be added in HTTP Authorization header to all requests that requires authentication. HTTP authentication must follow Bearer scheme, e.g.:
- Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
- Add a middleware which will proxy all the requests (except /login) and check that HTTP Authorization header has the correct value of JWT token.
- In case of the HTTP Authorization header in the request is absent or invalid or doesnâ€™t follow Bearer scheme, the middleware should stop further router method execution and return HTTP 401 code (Unauthorized error) and the corresponding error message.
- Add admin user to DB on service start with login = admin and password = admin
